This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand customer behavior, booking patterns, cancellations, and revenue performance. The analysis explores how factors such as hotel type, lead time, seasonality, and market segment impact bookings and cancellations. Key metrics like ADR (Average Daily Rate) are used to evaluate revenue trends. Insights from this analysis help hotels optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellation risks, target the right customer segments, and improve overall business decision-making to increase both revenue and guest satisfaction.
